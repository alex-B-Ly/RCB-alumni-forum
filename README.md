# Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Alumni Chat


This is a node.js chatroom application powered by Angular and Express. The central purpose of the RCB Alumni Chat is to provide a networking space that will encourage an ongoing dialogue between RCB Alumni as they search for internships, employment, become established in a new position, and continue to look for new opportunities.

RCB Alumni Chat will provide the main functions that users would expect from a chatroom, such as the ability to send, recieve, and edit messages, and the ability to customize your personal profile with an avatar, contact information, job title, list of skills, and recent projects.
